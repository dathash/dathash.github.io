        These albums were composed in the span of two weeks by me and my friend Bryce.
        They were premiered at viewing parties with friends.
        They were well received, but extremely rough.
        <em>Learned that creation is exceptionally easy, but curation is hard.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        This work is offensive and silly, but I don't disown the music we made here. It's a nice time capsule to see what life was like back in January 2022.

        <p>
        As for my current musical aims, I have been writing an average of one song a day this year.
        It is my intention to release another album as soon as I believe in the work enough.
