<p>The seminal question to a burgeoning young human being is a simple one.
Process or Dream?
That is, to say:
Do I find a mode of being which is agreeable to me for the most amount of time, or do I dedicate the innumerable days ahead of me to the pursuit of some grand aim?</p>
<p>The problem, which is simply worded and understood, has difficulty in processing.
Without speculating too much on the solution at first, one must first wonder from what source should the solution be found.</p>
<p>For many, the solution comes from an internal well of &quot;genius.&quot;
A desire, seemingly stronger than that of any other man, bubbling up to the surface from some subterranian depths.
We see this in Jonathan Blow, who possesses the desire to shunt his human animal and pursue only spritually fulfilling things.
We also might see the other side of this in a Hobbes or an Epicurus on the very other side of the coin, bringing some natural force through to enforce a life of process above any result.</p>
<p>For others, the decision is set forth by some discovery.
A man, wandering through life without an answer to the above question, comes across something that changes him forever.
The firstborn child makes the man realize that he must do what he can for them.
A grave loss sets off a chain of inspiration and industry. Etc, etc.
However, my lack of examples for most of these historical answers gives way to another important distinction about this problem.
Namely that very few people in the history of man have ever had to decide.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>To the ancient Greeks, the most arrogant of the historical peoples I know of, their greatness is due entirely to their deeds.
An answer, given to them by the nature and condition of their birth.</p>
<p>To those of the middle ages, and the many, many impoverished folk of history, the answer is again obvious.
The divine result of a Heaven before you, or the more earthen result of food on the table.</p>
<p>Results are the eternal champions of history, with process winning only a consolation prize every now and again in the lives of the wealthy and able.</p>
<p>It seems that our only peers in this choosing are the great emperors and landholders who, through some philosophizing or call to action, chose against their natural place as the enjoyers of life, and won through</p>
<h2 id="relation">Relation</h2>
<p>So then, which are we, the first ever entire generation of choosers, to choose?</p>
<p>That choice is up to each and every person.
Though if I were to extend a guess, I would expect no less than ninety-nine percent of all people to pursue the process.
And the more power to them! A great future lies ahead in the moments of life.
A deep satisfaction of soul bubbling up from the seat of being.</p>
<p>But to me, there is bound to be something else in my life.
Perhaps I am not what I believe I am, but I can feel the dissatisfaction with that mode of living coming even before I have been born into it.
There is a Benjamin Franklin lying deep within me, and I know that if I conclude my life without finding him, I will have missed something great.</p>
