<p>The thought I now quarrel with is one of great importance once again. It might be the meaning of my life.</p>
<p>What is learning?</p>
<p>To learn, as I know it, is the seminal act of progress in life. It is the choice to step forward, rather than falling back into habits. Whether by nature or by programming, our minds seek comfort, routine, tradition, and numbness. To learn is to open the eyes and ears to a new mode of being, leaving the old dead one behind.</p>
<p>This is obviously terrifying. My body and mind work together to stop me from pursuing learning at all costs. They beg me to seek some more comfortable mode of being, some masturbatory fantasy or delicious, nourishing food. And so I go along, sunk beneath the waves of my own spirit, with my soul remaining parched and malnourished all the while.</p>
<p>It is not a particular fault of mine that I remain here. It is, in fact, due to my dedication to ending this cycle that I ended up here. Most people enjoy routine and the stillness it provides. It entertains while stroking the ego and social standing of those participants. Work entertains just as much as it produces.</p>
<p>So I decided to lose the framework provided for me. To set out without any guidance or routine. And I have failed.</p>
<p>It is in the core of the experiment itself that I have failed, as well. I must face that fact. I am utterly unable to learn from the ground up, to trust the process, and also to face my own deficiencies. It is my fault.</p>
<p>Learning, too, must be learned, and I have just begun. So it is with great courage that I beseech you, self, trust in this. The learning must be done, for it is all that there is to do. Deny the black waters of comfort their grinning, malicious victory, and keep drilling into the center of things.</p>
<p>Do not forget what you are on this earth to do.</p>
