                <h1>Fun Over Time</h1>

<p>
It has been made clear to me throughout my life that over time, things change.
Not just times or values or anything external like that, but real change seems to come even within ourselves.
The one way I can perceive this change most clearly is in what I consider to be fun.
</p>
<p>
The most sublime and wonderful of experiences as a child was the glorious weekend.
I was allotted screen time for those precious two days, and I spent it gleefully.
I played hours upon hours of video games, from Mario Galaxy to Halo Reach, and beyond.
These games and these times are special to me now, and when I think of them I get a certain warm feeling, which is indescribable.
</p>
<p>
But I can't get there anymore.
In my spare time, which is even more precious to me than before, I sometimes attempt to play some games.
To no avail. Why?
Have the games changed since I was a kid? Have I?
Upon my reflection, it is I who have changed.
Games remain a gleeful experience for those who love them, but I am not one of them anymore.
I find myself at peace with this resolution, for I know who I am now.
Man cannot deride what he is, or long for what he was; he can only invoke the true present and pursue the future.
</p>
<h2>Further Fears</h2>
<p>
In further reflection, however, there is more to this phenomena than is initially obvious.
If this were to take place with another of my precious enjoyments in life, would I so easily leave it behind, with a smile and a wave?
It's not so difficult to come back to games and realize that they just don't do it for me anymore.
<em>What about love? Family? Programming? Music?</em>
</p>
<p>
What I seek is a guarantee that these pleasures will not flee with time as games have fled from me.
In seeking that guarantee, I've found a few useful data points.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Food seems to just get better and better as I eat more of it.
	<li>Biology has not yet lost any luster.
	<li>Enjoyment of certain things becomes different, more complex.
		<ul>
			<li>Specific Example: Dungeons and Dragons.
				I am not capable of enjoying the DnD we played in yesteryears, but I now
				play a new form of the game, which prioritizes things that I and my players love
				about the game now.
		</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, I want to stress that while I've lost most of the things I enjoyed before (Youtube, Games, etc), I keep finding new things I like even more.
The same thrill comes to me when I'm in flow state while programming, or reading some special book (most recently, <em>Dune</em>).
There seems to be less things that get me there these days, but that's most likely recency bias at play.
</p
<p>
In Conclusion, I'm happy with the trajectory that things are going.
I still don't have a guarantee, but I've got enough confidence not to worry about it.
And hey, every once in a while I pick up some new game and feel pretty good about it.
Here's to that feeling once again.
