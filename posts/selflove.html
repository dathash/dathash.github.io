                <h1>Self Love</h1>

<p>If you were to love yourself, truly and with the best possible outlook, would you be kind? Would you have expectations of yourself? This is the new conundrum I seek a resolution for.</p>
<p>Love is the driving force behind all actions worth pursuing. It is out of love of life, not hate, that great art, works, and learning is pursued. Once a man begins to despise, his sails are cut, and he has no choice but to be drawn through the current by whatever desire the waves of his human animal pursue. This much is clear to me, now more than ever, as there is no motivation to be had in hatred or disgust, only in love.</p>
<p>However, there is something more that I must now face. If a person is to dedicate themselves fully and wholeheartedly to love, how does one hold oneself accountable? If Love is the great feeling you have, then what comes when that which you love shirks its responsibilities? When it becomes disdainful and wretched? What happens when that which you love misses the mark, sins against itself, and begins to slope downwards? What is the proper attitude by which you address the one which you love?</p>
<h2 id="approaches">Approaches</h2>
<p>There is, of course, the approach of &quot;tough love.&quot; This approach comes from a diverse range of places. For some, deep down they disdain the target, and tough love is actually a smokescreen for their hate to run wild behind. For others, though, they truly love the target, and believe that being hard on them is the right course of action that will lead to the best possible outcome for them. This is the source of mystery. How can you act sharply, sternly, with severe expectation, and yet with complete love?</p>
<p>It is Nietzsche who said that the greatest Love is actually the greatest Hate, and this mystery has not been better stipulated since. I understand its pursuit and its implication, but have not yet internalized this teaching to my own self.</p>
<p>The second and most meaningless approach, of course, is the pitiful and merciful approach, which does not befit a man. To treat himself as a child, worthy of nothing but kisses and cuddles. To fellate himself over and over, to assure him that although he missed the mark, he is still worthy of affection. While there is a time and a place for this, its application in most things is to be scorned. Whiplash would not be a film of beauty if at the end he left the stage to his father&#39;s arms, never to return to glory again.</p>
<p>However, seen in another light, there is something missing from this glory. Griffith&#39;s inability to accept a peaceful, happy life is despicable, and his ruthless self-hatred (self-respect, paradoxically) drives him to inhumanity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t seek the type of glory that would require domination of all desires and senses...&quot;</p>
<p>Is that true? Is it actually the case that I seek a life of both? I do not know the consequence of such a lifestyle, and I am yet to comprehend even the simplest consequence of my own lifestyle. It is in the magical land of forms and fairies that I make any judgement upon the worthiness of my cause. There is but one star to pursue, and it might be glimpsed if I could see how short a life I am given.</p>
<p>More accurately, I don&#39;t know. No answer has become clear to me yet, though I do understand that suffering unduly is worthless, and despairs me. It is not worth the injury I might undertake for such an unknown and useless cause - Not yet at least. I will continue to seek with love and come one day to the gates of dream, and on that day, I will lay down my life for him.</p>
